This project focuses on developing a machine learning classification system to predict cancer risk levels (Low, Medium, High) based on patient data including air pollution exposure and genetic factors. The dataset contains approximately 1,000 patient records with 23 features such as age, air pollution index, genetic risk, smoking habits, and various medical symptoms. We implemented and compared three classification algorithms: Logistic Regression for baseline linear modeling, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) for instance-based learning, and Support Vector Machines (SVM) for optimal hyperplane separation. The complete workflow includes data preprocessing, data leakage removal and hyperparameter optimization using GridSearchCV.
